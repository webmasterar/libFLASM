Pre-installation Instructions
=============================

This installation requires the extraction of the seqan library files.
Simply extract them from the seqan.zip file to the root of this project
ensuring the header (*.h) files are accessible in ./seqan/*. To unzip the
file on most Linux systems you write `unzip seqan.zip` in the terminal.

Basic Instructions
==================

Compilation requires a C++ 11 standard compiler such as the GNU gcc compiler.
On Linux this is usually installed by default and all you have to do is run
`make` in the terminal.
