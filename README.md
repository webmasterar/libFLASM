The libFLASM library can perform Fixed Length Approximate String Matching under
two distance models: Edit distance and Hamming distance.

Given a text *t* of length *n* and a pattern *x* of length *m*, libFLASM finds
any factor of length *h* <= *m* from *x* in *t* and reports the ending positions
where it finds matches.

The libFLASM library uses the namespace *libflasm* and you should include the
header of the library like so:

```
#include <libflasm.h>

using namespace libflasm;
```

The function signatures of libFLASM are:

```
/**
 * This is the libFLASM edit distance function.
 *
 * @param t The text (haystack) to search in
 * @param n The length of t
 * @param x The pattern which has factors that may be present in t
 * @param m The length of x
 * @param factor_length The length of a factor (needle)
 * @param max_error The maximum distance between the factor and a position in t to report
 * @return The discovered positions are returned in a set that can be iterated over
 */
ResultTupleSet flasm_ed ( unsigned char * t, unsigned int n, unsigned char * x, unsigned int m, unsigned int factor_length, unsigned int max_error );

/**
 * This is the libFLASM Hamming distance function.
 *
 * @param t The text (haystack) to search in
 * @param n The length of t
 * @param x The pattern which has factors that may be present in t
 * @param m The length of x
 * @param factor_length The length of a factor (needle)
 * @param max_error The maximum distance between the factor and a position in t to report
 * @return The discovered positions are returned in a set that can be iterated over
 */
ResultTupleSet flasm_hd ( unsigned char * t, unsigned int n, unsigned char * x, unsigned int m, unsigned int factor_length, unsigned int max_error );
```
These methods return a set of tuples and each tuple contains:

```
/**
 * A result tuple contains:
 * 	- pos_t The ending position of the match in t
 * 	- pos_x The ending position of the match in x
 * 	- error The distance between the factor and the match in t
 */
struct ResultTuple {
    unsigned int pos_t;
    unsigned int pos_x;
    unsigned int error;
};
```

The library also provides an iterator to loop through the results, each item of which is a ResultTuple:

```
/* example of how to iterate through a resultset */
ResultTupleSetIterator it;
for ( it = results.begin(); it != results.end(); ++it )
{
    ResultTuple res = *it;
    cout << "(" << res.pos_t << "," << res.pos_x << "," << res.error << ")" << endl;
}
```

To compile the library to create libflasm.so please read INSTALL.md.

To find out more about how to use the library you can look in the ./example folder.
